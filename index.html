        <b>Abstract</b>
          This paper introduces M2M-Gen, a multimodal framework for generating background music tailored to Japanese manga. The key challenges in this task are the lack of available data or a baseline. We propose M2M-Gen, an automated background music generation pipeline which produces background music for an input manga book. Initially, we use the dialogues in a manga to detect scene boundaries, then perform emotion classification and generate detailed captions for each page within a scene. GPT-4o transforms these detailed music captions into high-level musical directives that guide a text-to-music model to produce music aligned with the manga's evolving narrative. The effectiveness of M2M-Gen is confirmed through extensive subjective evaluations, showcasing its capability to significantly enhance the manga reading experience by synchronizing music that complements specific scenes.

                Ethereal orchestral piece with soft piano undertones, interlaced
                with melancholic violin solos, reminiscent of historical
                romance. Very gentle harp plucks accentuate moments of intimacy,

                melodies interspersed, evoking the vastness of the ocean and the

                of timeless romance and the breathtaking moments of connection
                between two souls. As the story unfolds, subtle choral harmonies
