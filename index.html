        <b>Abstract</b>
          This paper introduces M2M-Gen, a multimodal framework for generating background music tailored to Japanese manga. The key challenges in this task are the lack of available data or a baseline. We propose M2M-Gen, an automated background music generation pipeline which produces background music for an input manga book. Initially, we use the dialogues in a manga to detect scene boundaries, then perform emotion classification and generate detailed captions for each page within a scene. GPT-4o transforms these detailed music captions into high-level musical directives that guide a text-to-music model to produce music aligned with the manga's evolving narrative. The effectiveness of M2M-Gen is confirmed through extensive subjective evaluations, showcasing its capability to significantly enhance the manga reading experience by synchronizing music that complements specific scenes.
